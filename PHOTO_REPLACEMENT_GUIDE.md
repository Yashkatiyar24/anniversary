# ðŸ“¸ Photo Replacement Guide for Anniversary Page

## Overview
This guide will help you replace the 6 placeholder photos in your anniversary page with your personal photos. I've already updated the HTML file to reference local image files instead of the placeholder Pexels images.

## What I've Done For You
âœ… Created an `images/` directory in your project  
âœ… Updated the HTML file to reference local images:
- `images/memory1.jpg` - Replace with your Image 1 (couple selfie with hammock)
- `images/memory2.jpg` - Replace with your Image 2 (couple with white flower)
- `images/memory3.jpg` - Replace with your Image 3 (couple selfie outdoors)
- `images/memory4.jpg` - Replace with your Image 4 (couple close-up)
- `images/memory5.jpg` - Replace with your Image 5 (couple with "KISS ME" sunglasses)
- `images/memory6.jpg` - Replace with your Image 6 (couple at night with building)

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Next Steps

### Option 1: Local Development (If you have access to the files)
1. **Save your photos** to the `images/` folder with these exact names:
   - `memory1.jpg` - Your first couple photo
   - `memory2.jpg` - Your second couple photo  
   - `memory3.jpg` - Your third couple photo
   - `memory4.jpg` - Your fourth couple photo
   - `memory5.jpg` - Your fifth couple photo
   - `memory6.jpg` - Your sixth couple photo

2. **Open the anniversary page** by opening `anniversary-page.html` in your web browser

### Option 2: Using GitHub (Recommended since you can't work locally)
1. **Upload your photos to GitHub:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to the `images/` folder (or create it if it doesn't exist)
   - Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"
   - Upload your 6 photos with the exact names listed above

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"
   - Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/anniversary/anniversary-page.html`

### Option 3: Using Online Code Editors
1. **CodePen/JSFiddle:**
   - Copy the HTML content from `anniversary-page.html`
   - Upload your images to an image hosting service (like Imgur, Cloudinary, or GitHub)
   - Replace the `images/memory1.jpg` paths with the full URLs to your hosted images

2. **Repl.it or CodeSandbox:**
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Upload your images to the `images/` folder
   - Run the project

## ðŸ“‹ Image Requirements
- **Format:** JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Recommended size:** 500x500 pixels (square format works best)
- **File size:** Keep under 2MB each for faster loading
- **Names:** Must match exactly: `memory1.jpg`, `memory2.jpg`, etc.

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting
- **Images not showing?** Check that the file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- **Images too large?** Resize them to 500x500 pixels or compress them
- **Wrong format?** Convert to JPG format if needed

## ðŸŒŸ Final Result
Once you complete these steps, your anniversary page will display your beautiful personal photos instead of the placeholder images, creating a truly personalized celebration of your love story!
